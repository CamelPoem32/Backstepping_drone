# Backstepping Control of Drone

## Introduction
Drones are widely used for monitoring, rescue, supervision, and as aerial base stations. In the military, they reduce human losses and provide precise monitoring and strikes. Traditional PID controllers are commonly used but lack robustness for the nonlinear quadrotor system. Backstepping control, based on Lyapunov stability, is robust to parametric variations and ensures system stability.
